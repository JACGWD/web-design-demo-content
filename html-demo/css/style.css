/* Add your CSS here */

/* ======== SUGGESTED ORDER OF CSS RULES =========== 

1. DEFINE COLOR PALETTE (USING VARIABLES)
    1.1 Use names like 
        --body-bg-color 
        --header-bg-color
        See: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp

2. DEFINE FONTS FAMILIES (USING VARIABLES)
    2.1 Use Google fonts
    2.2 Use Adobe fonts
    2.3 Host your own fonts: see: https://www.transfonter.org
    2.4 Ensure that the fonts you convert in 2.3 can legally be used that way.
    2.5 See: https://github.com/JACGWD/Responsive-Design-Winter-2025/blob/main/week-9-notes.md#step-6-add-custom-fonts
    2.6 Use names like 
        --titles-font
        --body-font
        --caption-font, etc
        See: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp

3. ADJUST BASIC MARGINS AND PADDING FOR MOBILE
    3.1 Header will touch the edges of the screen: no top/left/right margins. Adjust margin bottom.
    3.2 Nav will touch the edges of the screen: no left/right margins. Adjust margin top/bottom.
    3.3 .flex-container has zero margins and padding
    3.4 main and aside must not touch the edges of the screen: adjust margins accordingly.
    3.4 Footer will touch the edges of the screen: no bottom/left/right margins. Adjust margin top.

4. USE A TYPESCALE
    4.1 Make sure your chosen fonts are loading on the page, and your H1 uses that font.
    4.2 Find the longest title used in your site
    4.3 Adjust the H1 font size so that it fits on a small mobile device (320px at minimum)
    4.4 Use type scale (https://spencermortensen.com/articles/typographic-scale/)
    4.5 See: https://github.com/JACGWD/Responsive-Design-Winter-2025/blob/main/week-9-notes.md#pick-your-font-size-for-mobile

5. GO WIDE
    5.1 Based on the width of your columns (ex: desktop image width or paragraph measure), calculate how wide a container must be to hold two columns of content.
    5.2 This value is your first media query.
    5.3 Set containers (ex: div.wrapper or .flex-container) to display content side-by-side starting at that width.
    5.4 See: https://github.com/JACGWD/Responsive-Design-Winter-2025/blob/main/week-8b-notes.md#setting-elements-side-by-side
    5.5 Repeat the steps 5.1 - 5.3 for adding a third column if necessary.
